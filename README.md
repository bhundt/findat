# FinDat
Python scripts for retrieving and plotting stock market indicators such as sentiments in social media,  Put- / Call-Rations, Volatility-Index, ...

## Indices and their meaning
TOTAL_PCR: total amount of put to calls. Rising PCRs can indicate worsening market conditions.
VIX_PCR: volatility put to call ration . Rising VIX_PCR means people expect less volatility (i.e. they sell their volatility)

## Ideas, TODOs
- Sentiment Analysis: newsapi?
- Do not store in csv, store in sqlite3 DB
- use /r/pennystocks
